Sea ice concentration (SIC) is provided by the University of Bremen~\refp{bib:Ludwig2021}. Fig.~\ref{fig:lf_sic} summarizes the LF and SIC during \mosaic wintertime.

We relate sea ice lead fraction to cloud observations above \polarstern following:

\colouredcircle LF products is analyzed within 50~km around the \polarstern (red star in Fig.~\ref{fig:lf_sic}, right) with updated coordinates every minute.\\

\colouredcircle Sea ice - atmosphere coupling conceptual model\\
Vertical gradient of water vapour transport ($\nabla WVT$) is calculated from specific humidity $q_v~\mathrm{[g~g^{-1}]}$ and horizontal wind $\vec{v}_w~\mathrm{[m~s^{-1}]}$ from radiosonde profiles, following
\begin{equation}
	\nabla \mathrm{WVT} = -\frac{10^2}{g}~|q_v\cdot \vec{v}_w|~\frac{dP}{dz}
\end{equation}
The direction of maximum transport (see grey lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:lf_sic}) is used to relate LF with zenith observations at \polarstern.

\colouredcircle Planetary boundary layer height (PBLH)\\
Estimated via the bulk Richardson number \ref{eq:Rib}, PBLH is used as top layer below which the maximum $\nabla WVT$ is localized:
\begin{equation}
	Ri_b(z)\,=\,\frac{g}{\theta_v}\frac{\Delta \theta_v \,\Delta z}{\left( \Delta u \right)^2\,+\,\left(\Delta v \right)^2}
	\label{eq:Rib}
\end{equation}
%with $g$ is the constant of gravity, $\theta_v$ is the virtual potential temperature profile in K, $\Delta \theta_v\,=\,\theta_v-\theta_v(z_0)$, $\Delta u\,=\,u-u_0$, and $\Delta v\,=\,v-v_0$, the horizontal wind components in $\rm m~s^{-1}$. The $\Delta z\,=\,z - z_0$ with $z$ the altitude of the atmosphere layers in $\rm m$ and the subscript $0$ indicating the surface reference.

%\colouredcircle Cloud coupling classification: criteria based on the virtual potential temperature $\theta_v$ and location of maximum $\nabla~WVT$ below PBLH. The $\theta_v$ is analyzed to classify cases where the WVT is coupled or decoupled to the cloud.

\begin{itemize}
		\item Relating cloud observations with LF upwind with water vapour transport as conveying mechanism for the coupling as a plausible approach,
		\item When Leads are present, coupled clouds with larger LWP are more frequent,
		\item Increasing of LWP with LF (decreasing of SIC),
		\item Ice water shows no clear relation with sea ice LF or SIC,
		\item Cloud top temperature is warmer and cloud layer thicker for coupled obs.,
		%\item Larger LF are acompanied by warmer cloud top, indicating a higher moisture content for those cases,
		\item Confirmation that coupled clouds are mainly low level clouds (similar for UtiqiaÇµvik, Alaska~\refp{bib:garfias2021}),
		%\item SAR based LF at 700~m spatial resolution are crucial, for this case study the same results cannot be reproduce by using passive SIC retrievals at 1~km resolution (see different pattern of SIC and LF in Fig.~\ref{fig:wdirwvt},
